Once there was a family of penguins-Flipper and Skipper the non-identical twin boy and girl.
They had a dad called Chilly and a mum called Peggy.
They also lived with their baby siter penguin Gwen.
Gwen was very quiet and always stuck by the twins.
However one day another penguin from another family came called Blizzard.
He found Gwen waddling behind her own family and told her to go with him to his family.
She said that she can't leave her family but Blizzard tricked her into telling her he will bring her back.
So she left. Suddenly Flipper and Skipper noticed Gwen ran off and decided to go looking for her.
However, she had completely disappeared.
Gwen missed her family.
Then the next day she found another baby penguin called Waddle.
And she instantly knew who she was.
She knew her from waddling school.
So she told her that Blizzard took her from her family and is now lost.
Waddle knew exactly how to get back and they both waddled back and Flipper and Skipper saw Gwen.
He flapped his arms and skipper waddled to get her and they hugged and Skipper said that from now on we will never leave you alone.
